						I'm Miro, and I appreciate you checking out my page. <br />
						<br />
						This website serves as a collection of my previous projects and as a
						little archive for my other stuff. You'll find my latest projects
						below, from fun little experiments and pages to useful tools. <br />
						<br /> When I'm not chilling in my browser, I'm lost in the
						enchanting world of music. I'll maybe share my musical inspirations,
						favorite tunes, and perhaps even some original compositions at a
						later point. <br />
						<br /> I also really love 3D stuff, so i maybe put some of this
						stuff here as well.{' '}
